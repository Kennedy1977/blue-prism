### NOTES:

## Testing

I have written some basic tests using React Testing Library, not used it before, if I had a bit more knowledge then I would of written more extensive tests. TDD / Integration testing, I am in process of learning.

## CSS

I was considering taking my usual route of writing the CSS using SCSS or JSS, but project is small, so have written the CSS out as a single file 260 lines.

I have used a CSS Grid technique which does not require breakpoints, to make the site responsive and work across all screen sizes.
